Palindrome it is not as it sounds.
Palindrome is something like if it reversed it should sound same. 
Ex.name = kappak , if kappak is reversed, reverse = kappak. Hence, name==reverse so this is palindome.
Same applies to numbers, num = 123321, reversed = 123321. Hence, num==reverse.
This can be checked in various methods
First in simple method we can check using fisrt and last index are same or not. If it is same it is palindrome else not a palindrome.
Second method is to reverse the give input using slicing method and store it in a variable. Then check both the variable is same or not.
You can use If Else loop, While loop, recursion , string slicing for string.
